              In line with this commitment, Codix has formalized a Memorandum of
              Understanding with Olabisi Onabanjo University to develop courses
              in the fields of biosensors and nanotechnology. The core objective
              of this collaboration is to facilitate skill development among
              undergraduate students, ensuring they are exposed to the latest
              advancements in these specialized fields. Through hands-on
              training and industry-relevant learning experiences, students
              acquire practical skills directly applicable to the dynamic
              landscape of healthcare.

              It also aims to enhance career opportunities for students by
              aligning curricula with industry needs. This strategic approach
              prepares students to meet the evolving demands of the healthcare
              sector, positioning them as highly sought-after professionals. Our
              approach goes beyond theory. Undergraduate students have the
              opportunity to complete their SIWES placements with Codix Group,
              gaining practical experience in real-world industry environments.
              We are also proud that some graduates of the programme have gone
              on to join Codix after completing their studies, helping to reduce
              the gap between graduation and employment in specialized
              healthcare fields.
